title: Week 9 (August 8-14) 
---

This week I finished the first draft of the literature review and completed the Milestone 3 progress report. This process was very rewarding, as writing the paper and combining 50+ scholarly articles in a cohesive composition was incredibly challenging. Dr. Alonzo and my research partner Jessica Polk-Willams were very supportive, our weekly meetings encouraged me to keep typing! The first draft is 15 pages in bi-column style and roughly 20 pages in a typical layout.  During this process, I learned so much about technical writing and had to ironically unlearn a lot of writing practices taught in grammar school and college. For example, I did not realize that quoting from external sources is unnecessary and that flowery language actually hinders comprehension. I know I have a lot of edits ahead of me, however I am excited for what's to come of this draft. 

In addition, this week I also made a new presentation of survey topics, based on the critics of the summer research team. After meeting, Dr. Alonzo thinks I am in a  better position to begin forming the questionnaire. Aside from paper edits, next week Jessica and I plan to start with a draft of 50 questions and will condense it over time, based on feedback
