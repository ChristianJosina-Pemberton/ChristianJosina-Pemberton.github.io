title: Weeks 15-16 (September 16-30) 
---

The final weeks I spent my time condensing the survey draft from 50-25 questions. My research partner Jessica Polk-Willams was very helpful; together we were able to produce a second draft, making sure to follow Dr. Alonzo’s suggestions.

I also took time to complete the citations for the literature review. I learned all about Research Citing programs such as Overleaf, and PaperPile. After collecting the bib-tex, (or citation code) required for Overleaf, I was able to add citations throughout the literature review. Earlier, once I learned the paper would have to be significantly cut, I feared I wouldn’t be able to include all of my sources. However, in this process I learned how to cite multiple references, with the same findings. This way, I was actually able to include the majority of my past research; the final count of sources is 52! 

This DREAM program was a rich experience. The internship not only boosted my skills and confidence in research, but also led to a new employment opportunity as a Research Assistant for the Fall semester. As an RA I will continue to work on this project with Dr. Alonzo and Jess,  and gain more experience with surveys and potentially interviews, should time allow. 

_I am very grateful. Highly Recommended!_
