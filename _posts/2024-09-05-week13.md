This period, I spent my time redefining the topics in the literature review. I noticed that whilst editing, the narrative started to make less sense and lacked flow. To remedy this issue, I restructured the paper, by changing titles, combining sections and writing clear definitions for certain concepts. This process was surprisingly challenging and time consuming, I wrote multiple drafts and took many attempts at re-summarizing my previous work. Additionally, I wrote two more sub-sections, regarding AI Innovation and Disabled Content Creators. These sections were the culmination of recent research patches, due to oversight and iteration.  As the semester started, I remember feeling dismayed because I knew I would have less time to devote to the literature review and feared its quality would therefore lack. However, the final draft is my best graduate piece of work yet, I am very proud of it.
