title: Week 12 (August 29 - September 4) 
---

This week, Jessica and I received feedback regarding our survey design. I learned a lot, as I had no idea how much detail and technical writing goes into constructing a survey. I learned that the goal is to maximize the possibility of insightful responses by making the survey as simple and easy to complete as possible. Things such as open-ended, and yes/or no questions are typically avoided, and questions should be casted on a scale, mainly the Likert scale, in efforts to ascertain nuance in responses. What’s more is that survey questions should include a baseline and comparative element. Dr. Alonzo taught us that if we structure questions in charts we can comparatively view responses and potentially reveal a great contrast. We also learned about consistency, and how verbiage must repeat to maximize understanding. I hadn’t realized how often I change words and use different synonyms throughout my writing until we all reviewed the draft together. 

Also, through survey drafting, the team discovered a new perspective–that of sensory disabled content creators, who were not explicitly mentioned in the literature review. To fix this, I conducted a third mini literature search, focusing on this perspective.
