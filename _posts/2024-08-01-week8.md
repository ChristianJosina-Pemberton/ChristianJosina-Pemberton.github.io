title: Week 8 (August 1-8) 
---

This week I wrote one of the two remaining sections and created a slide dec, based on potential survey topics. Our research plan has been edited, we will conduct one survey round late Fall. My assignment this week was to start ideating survey topics based on the literature review topics. After making the slide deck in Canva, I presented my thoughts to Dr. Alonzo, in our weekly meeting. He then suggested I present again to his summer research team of HCI grad students, in hopes to get new perspectives. Though nervous, the presentation went great, the students offered insightful feedback and helped me see that some topics were repetitive. In addition, making the survey topics helped me see that some of the topics within my paper needed refining. Though not ecstatic about rewriting; I embraced the iterative journey of research and tailored my draft of the literature review accordingly.
