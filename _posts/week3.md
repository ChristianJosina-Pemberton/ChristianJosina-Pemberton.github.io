title: Week 2 (July 1st- July 10th) 
---

(3 day work week combined) 

This week I devoted half my time to filling out the IRB registration form, and the other half to the literature review. IRB stands for Institutional Review Board; for the study Dr. Alonzo will need to submit the form and earn approval in efforts to seek publication. My job, as lead student researcher, is to create a draft of the IRB form, in effort to illuminate areas of attention that will assist him in his final edit. The process of filling out the IRB form was very tedious, but nonetheless exciting. As a novice, I value daily experiences that a UX researcher would typically encounter; as it helps inform my decision process, regarding future career choices. Though arduous and very confusing at times, my excitement kept me going. I compiled a long list of 14 questions and designed some study promotional posters (attached below) that I am looking forward to reviewing with Dr. Alonzo, this upcoming Wednesday. 


Regarding the literature review, in our previous session, Dr. Alonzo showed me a new method in my approach to taking notes, per scholarly paper. The new method involves a formal summary of the paper's purpose, methodology, findings, and discussion. For reference, previously I wrote bullet notes for each paper, regarding key findings only; at the end of the paper summary I listed a key connection between the paper and the purpose of my literature review.  

To be honest at first, I found the new method hard to adjust to and was disappointed in my decreased progress, as writing longer summaries resulted in less ground covered, from new articles. However, as time progressed I found the new method enjoyable. It encouraged me to enjoy the process of research and given that I could only review half a dozen papers in a week’s time, my selection criteria became more tailored to the specific line of discovery I was investigating. I also found that I became more knowledgeable from different angles, within the sub topic I chose. 

For example, one paper mentioned the term “online disinhibition”, which is defined by a new sense of freedom people have in online settings, that then enables them to act in a certain manner they would not in person. Along this thread, I discovered other papers that related cases of online disinhibition to audism; the act of the discrimination against Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) persons. Lastly, this train of investigation led to more discovery regarding the privileges of hearing persons and how online anonymity is a right DHH persons don’t have access to, due to their cultural communication method-American Sign Language (ASL). Overall, the papers selected helped develop a cohesive story of the origins of audism, online disinhibition, and the lack of online privacy available for DHH communities. Before, my research seemed like a compilation of many pieces of puzzles, whereas this time each round my research informed the next journey of discovery.
