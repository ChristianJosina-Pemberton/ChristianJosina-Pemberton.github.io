title: Weeks 10-11 (August 15-28) 
---

For the latter half of August, Jess and I met and chatted frequently via Slack, to create the first draft of the Survey Questions. This process was fun, I felt like a true researcher for once. Thinking about the particular insights questions could warrant made me feel hopeful about our progress and the potential accessibility problems we could illuminate.

During this time, Dr. Alonzo notated several suggestions to the paper and mentioned that for IRB submission, the literature review would have to be significantly condensed, to 2-5 pages. In addition to survey drafting, I looked over the paper edits and began theorizing ways to trim the paper down. In these weeks, I also realized that a huge section of the literature review captured the wrong insights. I had accidentally included all technological innovations versus strictly AI innovations, for sensory disabled users. To remedy this mistake I conducted a second, mini literature search focusing on specifically AI accessibility innovation.
