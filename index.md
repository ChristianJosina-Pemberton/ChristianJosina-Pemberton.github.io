## About Me

My name is Christian Josina Pemberton. I am a novice UX Designer & Researcher, currently achieving my second Masters of Science in Human Computer Interaction, at DePaul University. I started my journey as a Marketer and graduated with my first Masters of Science in Digital Marketing, from Yeshiva University back in 2021. Since then I have fallen in love with the world of User Experience and have found useful tools of application from both degrees. My career interests have always revolved around the intersection between consumers, products, society, and most intriguingly how these three dynamics influence each other on a case-by case basis. Since I was a kid, I have always had  such a wonderment for fables, mysteries and puzzles. In my adulthood, such fascination tracks as I enjoy opportunities to dissect the known and unknown wants of audiences, in regards to the design of everyday products. I appreciate how this research, then intimately informs the design process. To view some of my past projects click [here](https://www.cj-ux.com/).


## About My Advisor

My Mentor is Dr. Oliver Alonzo, a Assistant Professor at DePaul University’s School of Computing. He obtained his PhD from the Computing and Information Sciences program at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), where he was advised by Matt Huenerfauth, a Professor and Dean of the Golisano College of Computer and Information Sciences at RIT . His previous experiences include a year as a post-doctoral Assistant Professor at Creighton University, and internships at Facebook and Adobe Research as a UX and HCI Researcher, respectively.

Dr. Alonzo's work focuses on Computing Accessibility and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). His research includes the application of automatic text simplification tools to assist online reading by people who are Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing, as well as tools to assist American Sign Language learners. He focus on the user-centric design and evaluation of such tools, as well as the evaluation metrics of the performance of underlying technologies that power them.

## About My Project

User-generated content is increasingly abundant online, but it is most often not made accessible for people with sensory disabilities. Current research has explored remedial approaches using AI to make inaccessible content accessible. However, automatic processes are typically decoupled from the content’s author and may introduce errors or misinterpretations of the authors’ intentions. Thus, as part of my long-term research, I aim to explore how AI can be used to support authors in creating accessible content from the start. To lay the groundwork this long-term vision, in this project, I propose a survey and two interview studies involving people with sensory disabilities, and content creators who are popular among our survey respondents, to explore users’ accessibility needs and the experiences of content creators in producing accessible content – or lack thereof – and their best practices or challenges in doing so.
